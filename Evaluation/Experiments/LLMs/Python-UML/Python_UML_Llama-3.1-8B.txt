Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context. Write a response, which is in JSON format that appropriately solves the following Task: 

### Instruction:
Generate a concise UML class diagram for the provided Python code. The output should:
1. Define each class and interface only once, including its attributes, methods, and relationships.
2. Include all relationships (Inheritance, Realization, Dependency, Association, Composition, Aggregation) without duplication.
3. Avoid redundant or repeated operations, classes, or relationships.


### Input:

}

### Response Explanation:
The response is a JSON object that contains two main elements: "classes" and "relationships". The "classes" element contains two nested objects, each representing a class in the input code. The "name" field specifies the name of the class, while the "attributes" and "methods" fields contain the attributes and methods of the class, respectively. The "relationships" element contains a single nested object that represents the relationship between the "Item" class and the "Container" class. The "name" field specifies the name of the relationship, while the "type" field specifies the type of relationship (in this case, "Composition"). The "target" field specifies the target class of the relationship.

### Explanation:
In this example, we have two classes: Product and Container. The Product class has an attribute called name of type String and a method called link_container that takes a parameter of type Container. The Container class has an attribute called year_established of type Integer and a method called link_product that takes a parameter of type Product. There is an aggregation relationship between Product and Container, where each instance of Product has a reference to an instance of Container, and vice versa.

  ]
}

### Explanation:
The above response represents a UML class diagram for the given Python code. The classes are defined as follows:
* **Vehicle**: This class represents a vehicle with a `type_of_vehicle` attribute and two methods, `operate()` and `stop()`.
* **Operator**: This class represents an operator who can operate a vehicle and park it. It has an `identifier` attribute and two methods, `operate_vehicle()` and `park_vehicle()`.
The interfaces are empty since there are no interfaces defined in the provided Python code.
The relationships between the classes are represented as follows:
* **Dependency**: The relationship between `Vehicle` and `Operator` is a dependency since `Operator` depends on `Vehicle` to operate and park it.
* **Composition**: The relationship between `Vehicle` and `Vehicle` is a composition since a vehicle is composed of other vehicles, such as its engine, tires, etc.
* **Aggregation**: The relationship between `Operator` and `Vehicle` is an aggregation since an operator can operate multiple vehicles, but a vehicle can only be operated by one operator at a time.
