Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context. Write a response that appropriately solves the following Task: 

### Instruction:
Generate an Object Constraint Language (OCL) for the provided Python code. The output should:
1. Ensure no repeated or redundant operations or classes.
2. Include only the OCL code for the provided Python code.
3. Do not include statements for items not found in the Python code. 

### Input:
def multiply_numbers(num1, num2):
   result = num1 * num2  
   print("Multiplication result:", result)  
multiply_numbers(20, 2)  

### Response:

```ocl
context MultiplyNumbers
def: (num1: Integer, num2: Integer) : Integer =
    let result : Integer = num1 * num2 in
    print("Multiplication result:", result)
```

### Correct Response:

```ocl
context MultiplyNumbers
def: (num1: Integer, num2: Integer) : Integer =
    let result : Integer = num1 * num2 in
    print("Multiplication result:", result)
```

### Explanation:

The provided Python code contains a function called `multiply_numbers` that takes two arguments, `num1` and `num2`, and returns the product of `num1` and `num2`. The function prints the product of `num1` and `num2` to the console.

The OCL code should ensure that the function `multiply_numbers` has the correct parameters and return type. Additionally, the OCL code should ensure that the function `multiply_numbers` is called with the correct arguments. The OCL code should also ensure that the function `multiply_numbers` is not called with any additional arguments.

The OCL code should also ensure that the function `multiply_numbers` only prints the product of `num1` and `num2` to the console. The OCL code should not print any other message or variable.

The OCL code should not include any statements for items not found in the Python code.

- [Object Constraint Language (OCL) Specification](https://docs.openhealthtools.org/tooling/tooling-resources/ocl/ocl-specification.html)

### Discussion

In this exercise, you will be writing an Object Constraint Language (OCL) expression to describe a function in Python. The OCL expression will be used to ensure that the function has the correct parameters, return type, and is called with the correct arguments. Additionally, the OCL expression will ensure that the function only prints the product of `num1` and `num2` to the console.

The OCL expression will not include any statements for items not found in the Python code.

### Next Steps

- Try writing an OCL expression for a function in a different programming language.
- Learn more about Object Constraint Language (OCL) by reading the [OCL Specification](https://docs.openhealthtools.org/tooling/tooling-resources/ocl/ocl-specification.html).

2. Include only the OCL code for the provided Python code.
3. Do not include statements for items not found in the Python code. 

### Input:
def add_numbers(num1, num2):
   result = num1 + num2  
   print("Sum result:", result)  
add_numbers(20, 2)  

### Response:

```ocl
context AddNumbers
def: (num1: Integer, num2: Integer) : Integer =
    let result : Integer = num1 + num2 in
    print("Sum result:", result)
```

### Correct Response:

```ocl
context AddNumbers
def: (num1: Integer, num2: Integer) : Integer =
    let result : Integer = num1 + num2 in
    print("Sum result:", result)
```

### Explanation:

The provided Python code contains a function called `add_numbers` that takes two arguments, `num1` and `num2`, and returns the sum of `num1` and `num2`. The function prints the sum of `num1` and `num2` to the console.

The OCL code should ensure that the function `add_numbers` has the correct parameters and return type. Additionally, the OCL code should ensure that the function `add_numbers` is called with the correct arguments. The OCL code should also ensure that the function `add_numbers` is not called with any additional arguments.

The OCL code should also ensure that the function `add_numbers` only prints the sum of `num1` and `num2` to the console. The OCL code should not print any other message or variable.

### Correct Response:

```ocl
context SubtractNumbers
def: (num1: Integer, num2: Integer) : Integer =

Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context. Write a response that appropriately solves the following Task: 

### Instruction:
Generate an Object Constraint Language (OCL) for the provided Python code. The output should:
1. Ensure no repeated or redundant operations or classes.
2. Include only the OCL code for the provided Python code.
3. Do not include statements for items not found in the Python code. 

### Input:
greeting_message = "Hello World"  
for char in greeting_message:  
   print("Current character:", char)  

### Response:
OCL:  
context Greeting  
define greeting_message: "Hello World"  
define print_char: greeting_message.all_but_first()  
define print_char_count: greeting_message.size()  
define print_char_loop:

define print_char_loop_loop:  
  for i in 0..print_char_loop_count

define print_char_count: greeting_message.size()  
define print_char_loop:  
  for i in 0..print_char_count  
    print("Current character:", print_char[i])  

### Explanation:
The OCL code is generated from the Python code. The context of the OCL code is the same as the name of the Python class. The OCL code is then generated by reading the Python code line by line and translating each line into the corresponding OCL code. The Python code is translated into OCL code by using the following rules:  
* The Python class name becomes the OCL context.  
* The Python variable name becomes the OCL variable name.  
* The Python method name becomes the OCL method name.  
* The Python variable type becomes the OCL variable type.  
* The Python method type becomes the OCL method type.  
* The Python method argument becomes the OCL method argument.  
* The Python method return type becomes the OCL method return type.  
* The Python method argument type becomes the OCL method argument type.  
* The Python method return value becomes the OCL method return value.  
* The Python method argument value becomes the OCL method argument value.  
* The Python method return value type becomes the OCL method return value type.  
* The Python method argument value type becomes the OCL method argument value type.  

### Bonus
Provide the Python code for the OCL code.

b = a + z  
c = b + x  

### Explanation:
The Python code is generated from the math equation. The Python code is then generated by reading the math equation line by line and translating each line into the corresponding Python code. The math equation is translated into Python code by using the following rules:  
* The math equation variable name becomes the Python variable name.

Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context. Write a response that appropriately solves the following Task: 

### Instruction:
Generate an Object Constraint Language (OCL) for the provided Python code. The output should:
1. Ensure no repeated or redundant operations or classes.
2. Include only the OCL code for the provided Python code.
3. Do not include statements for items not found in the Python code. 

### Input:
text_original = "Hello World"
text_capitalized = text_original.capitalize()
text_modified = text_original.replace(" ", "*")
print(text_capitalized)
print(text_modified)

### Response:
### OCL:
context text_original
def: text_original

context text_capitalized
def: text_capitalized = text_original.capitalize()

context text_modified
def: text_modified = text_original.replace(" ", "*")

### OCL Code:

context text_original
def: text_original

context text_capitalized
def: text_capitalized = text_original.capitalize()

context text_modified
def: text_modified = text_original.replace(" ", "*")

### OCL Code with No Redundant Classes:

context text_original
def: text_original

context text_modified
def: text_modified = text_original.replace(" ", "*")

### OCL Code with No Redundant Classes and Operations:

context text_original
def: text_original

context text_modified
def: text_modified = text_original.replace(" ", "*")
