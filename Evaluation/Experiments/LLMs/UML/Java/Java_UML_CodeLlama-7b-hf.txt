Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context. Write a response, which is in JSON format that appropriately solves the following Task: 

### Instruction:
Generate a concise UML class diagram for the provided Java code. The output should:
1. Define each class and interface only once, including its attributes, methods, and relationships.
2. Include all relationships (Inheritance, Realization, Dependency, Association, Composition, Aggregation) without duplication.
3. Avoid redundant or repeated operations, classes, or relationships.


### Input:
import java.util.*;
abstract class AbstractContract {
   public boolean validateTransaction(int senderID, int receiverID) {
      return senderID != receiverID;
   }
}
class Payment extends AbstractContract {
   private int senderID;
   private int receiverID;
   public int getSenderID() {
      return senderID;
   }
   public int getReceiverID() {
      return receiverID;
   }
}

- Car has an attribute named engine of type Engine.
- Driver has an attribute named experience of type float.
- Driver has an attribute named rating of type float.
- Driver has an attribute named car of type Car.
- Engine has an attribute named horsepower of type int.

The following classes are extracted from the input:
- Car
- Driver
- Engine
