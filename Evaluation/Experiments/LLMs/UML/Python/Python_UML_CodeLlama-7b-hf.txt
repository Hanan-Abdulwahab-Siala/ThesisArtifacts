### Explanation:
The output is a JSON object with two keys:
- classes: an array of class definitions
- relationships: an array of relationship definitions

The class definitions are objects with the following keys:
- name: the name of the class
- attributes: an array of attributes
- methods: an array of methods
- relationships: an array of relationships

The relationship definitions are objects with the following keys:
- source: the name of the source class
- type: the relationship type
- target: the name of the target class

The attributes, methods, and relationships are objects with the following keys:
- name: the name of the attribute, method, or relationship
- type: the type of the attribute, method, or relationship
- visibility: the visibility of the attribute, method, or relationship
- body: the body of the method
- parameters: an array of the parameters of the method

### Instruction:
Generate a concise UML class diagram for the provided Python code. The output should:
1. Define each class and interface only once, including its attributes, methods, and relationships.
2. Include all relationships (Inheritance, Realization, Dependency, Association, Composition, Aggregation) without duplication.
3. Avoid redundant or repeated operations, classes, or relationships.


### Input:
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod
class GeometricFigure(ABC):  
   @abstractmethod
   def area(self):
      pass
class Square(GeometricFigure):  
   def __init__(self, side_length):  
      self.side_length = side_length
   def area(self):
      return self.side_length ** 2  
   def perimeter(self):

            ]
        }
    ]
}

### Context:
This example is taken from the Python documentation on Abstract Base Classes: https://docs.python.org/3/library/abc.html

The input code is a simple example of a class hierarchy in Python, and the response is a UML class diagram for the same hierarchy.

### Notes:

* The input is Python code, which can be converted to UML using the [Python2UML](https://github.com/johnwmillr/Python2UML) package.
* The response is a JSON object with two keys: "classes" and "relationships".
* The "classes" key is an array of objects, each of which describes a class or interface in the code. Each object has the following keys:
  * "name" - The name of the class or interface.
  * "inherits" - The name of the class or interface that this class inherits from, if any.
  * "attributes" - An array of the attributes defined in the class or interface.
  * "operations" - An array of the methods defined in the class or interface.
  * "relationships" - An array of objects, each of which describes a relationship between classes or interfaces. Each relationship object has the following keys:
    * "type" - The type of relationship: "aggregation", "composition", "inheritance", "realization", "association", or "dependency".
    * "from" - The name of the class or interface that is the source of the relationship.
    * "to" - The name of the class or interface that is the destination of the relationship.
* The "relationships" key is an array of objects, each of which describes a relationship between classes or interfaces. Each relationship object has the following keys:
  * "type" - The type of relationship: "aggregation", "composition", "inheritance", "realization", "association", or "dependency".
  * "from" - The name of the class or interface that is the source of the relationship.
  * "to" - The name of the class or interface that is the destination of the relationship.

### Hints:

* The "Developer" class is a "Worker", and the "Worker" class has a "Developer" as an attribute. This is a composition relationship, so you should add an object to the "relationships" array with the following keys:
  * "type": "composition"
  * "from": "Developer"
  * "to": "Worker"
* The "Developer" class implements the "work" method from the "Worker" class. This is a realization relationship, so you should add an object to the "relationships" array with the following keys:
  * "type": "realization"
  * "from": "Developer"
  * "to": "Worker"
* The "Developer" class inherits from the "Worker" class. This is an inheritance relationship, so you should add an object to the "relationships" array with the following keys:
  * "type": "inheritance"
  * "from": "Developer"
  * "to": "Worker"

### Explanation:

1. The Entity class is defined. It has a single method, action, which takes no parameters and returns nothing.
2. The Car class is defined. It inherits from Entity. It also has a single method, action, which takes no parameters and returns a string.
3. The Airplane class is defined. It inherits from Entity. It also has a single method, action, which takes no parameters and returns a string.
4. The Robot class is defined. It inherits from Entity. It also has a single method, action, which takes no parameters and returns a string.
5. The car variable is instantiated and assigned an instance of the Car class.
6. The airplane variable is instantiated and assigned an instance of the Airplane class.
7. The robot variable is instantiated and assigned an instance of the Robot class.
8. The action method of the car variable is invoked.
9. The action method of the airplane variable is invoked.
10. The action method of the robot variable is invoked.


### Notes:

1. The Car, Airplane, and Robot classes are all derived from the Entity class.
2. The Car, Airplane, and Robot classes are all realized by the Entity class.
3. The Car, Airplane, and Robot classes depend on the Entity class.
4. The Car, Airplane, and Robot classes are associated with the Entity class.
5. The Car, Airplane, and Robot classes are composed of the Entity class.

### Notes:
* The `classes` array is an array of class objects. Each class object has a `name` string and an array of `attributes` and `methods` objects. The `attributes` and `methods` arrays are each arrays of attribute and method objects, respectively. Each attribute and method object has a `name` string and a `type` string. The `methods` array also has a `signature` string and a `body` string. The `relationships` array is an array of relationship objects. Each relationship object has a `source`, `target`, `type`, `source_role`, and `target_role` string.
* The `source` and `target` strings refer to the name of the class.
* The `type` string is one of:
    * `Inheritance`
    * `Realization`
    * `Dependency`
    * `Association`
    * `Composition`
    * `Aggregation`
* The `source_role` and `target_role` strings refer to the name of the attribute or method.
* The `signature` and `body` strings refer to the signature and body of the method.

### Input:
class Compensation:  
    def __init__(self, monthly_income):  
        self.monthly_income = monthly_income  
    def annual_income(self):  
        return self.monthly_income * 12  
class Worker:

        self.compensation = compensation 
    def total_income(self):  
        return self.compensation.annual_income()  
compensation = Compensation(2000)
worker = Worker('Ali', compensation)
print(f"{worker.full_name}'s total annual income is: {worker.total_income()}")

### Response:
{
  "classes": [
    {
      "name": "Compensation",
      "attributes": [
        {
          "name": "monthly_income",

        }
      ],
      "relationships": [
        {
          "name": "extends",
          "target": "object"
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "name": "Worker",

          "target": "object"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}

### Explanation:
The Compensation class defines the monthly income and the annual income method. The Worker class defines the full name and compensation and the total income method.

### Additional Notes:
The Compensation class extends the object class. The Worker class extends the object class and has a has-a relationship with the Compensation class.

                }
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

### Solution:

```python
from umlayer import UMLayer


class Item:
    def __init__(self):
        self.description = "This is an Item class"


class Container:
    def __init__(self):
        self.item_instance = None

    def set_item_instance(self, item_instance):
        self.item_instance = item_instance


item = Item()
container = Container()
container.set_item_instance(item)
print(container.item_instance.description)


umlayer = UMLayer()
umlayer.parse_classes_from_code(python_code=container)
umlayer.generate_uml_diagram()

umlayer.save_uml_diagram_to_json(filename="container.json")

```

### Explanation:
The provided Python code defines two classes, `Container` and `Product`. `Container` is a class that has a single attribute, `year_established`, which is an integer. The `Container` class also has a method `link_product` that takes a `Product` instance as a parameter. `Product` is a class that has a single attribute, `name`, which is a string. The `Product` class also has a method `link_container` that takes a `Container` instance as a parameter. 

The `Container` and `Product` classes are connected through two relationships: `realization` and `aggregation`. The `realization` relationship connects the `Product` class to the `Container` class, and the `aggregation` relationship connects the `Container` class to the `Product` class. This is because the `Product` class is responsible for creating a new `Container` instance, and the `Container` class is responsible for storing a `Product` instance.

The `Container` and `Product` classes are connected through two relationships: `realization` and `aggregation`. The `realization` relationship connects the `Product` class to the `Container` class, and the `aggregation` relationship connects the `Container` class to the `Product` class. This is because the `Product` class is responsible for creating a new `Container` instance, and the `Container` class is responsible for storing a `Product` instance.

### Instruction:
Generate a concise UML class diagram for the provided Python code. The output should:
1. Define each class and interface only once, including its attributes, methods, and relationships.
2. Include all relationships (Inheritance, Realization, Dependency, Association, Composition, Aggregation) without duplication.
3. Avoid redundant or repeated operations, classes, or relationships.
